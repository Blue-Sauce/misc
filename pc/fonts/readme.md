Fronts designed to improve reading.

OpenDyslexic is an open source font created to help increase readability for readers with dyslexia. The typeface includes regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic styles. It is being updated continually and improved based on input from other dyslexic users. OpenDyslexic Mono is included for programming, or other areas where a fixed width font is preferred. 

OpenDyslexic 3 is now available in Regular and Bold! OpenDyslexic 3 is a ground-up redesign of OpenDyslexic, taking into account recommendations from educators, teachers, and other users. It is released under the SIL-OFL license.

People with dyslexia often swap, rotate and flip letters without noticing. The problem is that some letters are too similar to each other. Dyslexie font is designed so that every letter is unique in its own form. This counters the rotation, flipping and reversal of the letters. Sometimes they have a "crowding effect" (the apparent fusion of letters) because they are too close to each other. In addition, the font has extra distance between the letters (kerning) and between words (spaces). Dyslexic people may also overlook the beginning of a sentence and read two sentences as one. Therefore, the capital letters are bolder so the reader will easily identify the beginning of a new sentence.

Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.

The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin ( Deca, Exa, Giga, Mega, Peta, Tera, Zetta) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as "tracked out"). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.

Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.

True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.
